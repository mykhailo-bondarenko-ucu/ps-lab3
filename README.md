#### **NOTE:** To set up the local Consul Key-Value store, run `python3 setup.py`. This app assumes local Consul running in dev mode using `consul agent -dev`, and a local copy of Hazelcast running too. To start the app, call scripts `consul_run.sh`, `hz_run.sh` and `run.sh` in this order. Run `test.sh` to test the scripts.
